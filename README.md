# House Price Prediction Model

## Abstract
Predicting house prices accurately is crucial for real estate professionals, investors, and homeowners. This project aims to develop a robust house price prediction model using various regression algorithms. By analyzing key features of houses such as size, location, amenities, and neighborhood characteristics, the model aims to provide accurate price estimates.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build and compare multiple regression models to predict house prices based on a comprehensive set of features. By leveraging various regression algorithms, we seek to identify the most effective model that accurately predicts house prices in different real estate markets.

## Project Description
In this project, we will work with a dataset containing various features of houses, such as size (square footage), number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location details, proximity to amenities, and neighborhood attributes. The dataset also includes historical house sale prices, which serve as the target variable for prediction.

## Desired Problem Outcome (Objective or Goal)
The main goal is to develop a reliable house price prediction model using multiple regression algorithms. This model will assist real estate stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding property investments, pricing strategies, and market trends analysis.

## Regression Algorithms
The project will explore and compare the following regression algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- AdaBoost Regression
- XGBoost Regression
- LightGBM Regression
- CatBoost Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

## About the Data
The dataset includes the following features related to each house:

### House Features
- **Size:** Total square footage of the house.
- **Bedrooms:** Number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Bathrooms:** Number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Location:** Geographical location details.
- **Amenities:** Presence of amenities such as pool, garage, garden, etc.
- **Neighborhood:** Characteristics of the neighborhood (e.g., crime rate, school quality).

### Target Variable
- **Sale Price:** Historical sale price of the house.

## Instructions for Use
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.
   - Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features if necessary.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train each regression algorithm on the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate each model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Compare the performance of each algorithm to select the best-performing model.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data or test set.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the selected model in a production environment for real-time house price predictions if applicable.

## Example Code Snippet

```python
# Example code for model training and evaluation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Assuming 'X' contains features and 'y' contains the target variable 'Sale Price'
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate performance
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
